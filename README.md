# DraftSaver

HeyHo This is my DraftSaver.
It basicly works just like Loldraft or Prodraft but only locally.
I use it as a coaching tool for drafting or to brainstorm drafts for competitive matches.
Basicly you just start the programm Draft like in League but you can save the Drafts for better organization and look at them later.

TODO:
-Delete Button for Saved Drafts.
-More Stats
-Change Database to add Value to a Draft
-Calculate Draft suggestions based on older Drafts. (Maybe also based on Lol Win Rate Stats but not sure i want this).
